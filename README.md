#Clone a Webpage with Bootstrap

-Pick any web page on the internet.

-Briefly draw a rough wireframe for the the page’s layout.

-Use Bootstrap to make a clone of the webpage. Do not use any custom CSS. 

-Remember to use bootstrap components: Grid and Navbar, 

-Remember to use bootstrap’s “utility classes” like “m-5”, and “p-3” to add space around elements.

-Remember to use the “img-fluid” class to make images responsive to the size of their parent element.

-First work through all static components before attempting to add dynamic components. This way if you don’t succeed adding the dynamic components, you will still have a successful completed project at the end. 

-Use the placeholder.com to stub out images

-Once you have everything as close as possible to accurate with only bootstrap, then you can add minimal custom CSS.
